Digital Logic Design Using Verilog: A Portfolio Project Overview
Project Title: Implementation of Basic Logic Gates and Multiplexers in Verilog

Project Duration: January - March 2022

Tools Used: Vivado Design Suite

Project Description:

This project focuses on the foundational aspects of digital logic design through the practical application of Verilog programming. It showcases my ability to design, simulate, and analyze basic digital components, which are the building blocks of more complex digital systems. The project is structured around several key components, each highlighting a different aspect of digital logic and design principles.

Components Developed:

Half Adder: Demonstrated the creation of a basic arithmetic logic unit that performs addition of two single-bit numbers.
1-bit Full Adder: Advanced the half adder by incorporating a carry input, enabling the chaining of multiple adders for multi-bit addition operations.
4-bit Full Adder: Implemented a more complex adder capable of handling 4-bit binary numbers, illustrating the scalability of digital designs.
2:1 Multiplexer (MUX): Designed a basic multiplexer, showcasing my understanding of selection logic and conditional data forwarding.
4:1 Multiplexer: Developed a more advanced multiplexer with a 2-bit selection line, further exploring the multiplexing concept.
Project Approach:

The development process involved an initial phase of design conceptualization, followed by coding in Verilog within the Vivado Design Suite environment. Each component was first simulated to ensure correctness, then verified through test benches to validate functionality under various conditions. This iterative process helped refine my understanding of both digital logic fundamentals and the nuances of Verilog coding.

Challenges & Learning Outcomes:

Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges, including debugging simulation mismatches and optimizing logic for efficiency. Overcoming these obstacles enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of digital design principles. Moreover, this project solidified my proficiency with the Vivado Design Suite, from project setup to simulation analysis.

Conclusion:

This portfolio project reflects my journey through the basics of digital logic design, emphasizing practical experience with Verilog programming and simulation. It showcases my ability to navigate from conceptual design to functional verification, a crucial skill set for tackling more complex digital systems design in the future.
